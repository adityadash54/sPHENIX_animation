# sPHENIX_animation
Animation of the drifting of the clusters in the TPC generated by TPC Cluster_Drift_Animator.py. 
It can read the root file G4sPHENIX_g4svtx_eval.root generated by the Fun4All macro and also the json file for the event display and generate a Matplotlib animation and mp4 file with the collision rate and time displayed. 
User defined values: time_scale which is the factor by which time is dilated for the animation(the text on animation is actual time and is not dilated),TPC_drift_speed in cm/ms. 
Set name file to read in line 288 (json or root format) and do python3 TPC Cluster_Drift_Animator.py
In order to generate smaller animations and then merge them set number of iterations as iterations (line 295) and start_iterations (line 304) as the starting iteration from which animation is generated. Then merge the animations using ffmpeg.
